Actually, the first roll.

## a) One robot, two wheels
Structure of the robot, how it's moving. "treels".
We control each wheel by speed, not position (thanks god...)
How do we move around, Left & Right wheels speed. (forward, backward, turning, turning on yourself...).
Difference between a moving abstract shape, and a moving/rolling robot.
Differential Drive (? or at section on odometry?)

## b) Forces of attraction
Vector base force ? (When and how to add that in material...)
easier to sum up and have generic behavior

## c) Random walk

## d) ==Fog of war==
This section's Game: covering arena as best as you can.
