I confess a particularly strong love for those so called vehicules. Spawning from the realm of cybernetics (no kidding), those vehicules demonstrate a few things. First, you don't need complexe algorithm to have an interesting behavior. And most importantly, you don't need a complexe behavior displayed for humans (and animals) to project high cognition an assume the robot is more intelligent (or even sentient) than he really is. This is to say a lot about how actually we might project way too much on the sentient level while observing other humans...

##a) Vehicules and behaviors
We will play on 2 parameters that will characterise the wheel actuator and the light sensor. Both parameters can take two opposite values, suming up to four different behaviors. On the light sensor, either a robot will be attracted by the light, or it'll be repulsed by it. On the wheel actuator, either the robot will be faster as it gets closer to the light, or as it gets further from the light. Simpe isn't it? And yet you can create very meaningfull behavior from this little set up.

Each behavior have a specific name, I'll let you through observation quess why it is so. Let's start with a bit of love. 

##b) Lover
The lover is attracted by the light but grows slower as he's getting closer to it.

We already have the light vector force as attractive, but now the force is as strong as you're close, we need to inverse that.


##c) Agressor

Let's add a limit too to the range.

##d) Explorator

##e) Coward
