Now this is getting serious, the real game, the real competition but mainly ... the real exploration, together. The aim of domination would be to activate areas and link them with your team by rolling over them and light them with your team's color. To activate a spot, you need to have more robot than another team over the spot. Once a spot is activatedit would grow you a steady stream of points. Move fast to cover ground or travel as many to keep your spots, it's up to you! 
AI gaming is not yet a field. In this second half, the aim is to try to define it together, think of a game that could work, open enough while staying fun, and trying to create it together. The aim through the discussion is for me to create an interesting setup, and you to answer with better and better AIs and compete in the areas.
