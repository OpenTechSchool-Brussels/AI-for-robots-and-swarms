Now this is getting serious, the real game, the real competition. Here you will be provided a new arena with various spots on the ground and LEDs that will activate over it. You will have one color per team. To activate a spot, you need to have more robot than another team over the spot. Once a spot is activated, it becomes of your color and grow you a steady stream of points! The aim is to reach a pre defined score in order to win. Move fast to cover ground or travel as many to keep your spots, it's up to you! If you're feeling your AI is too strong, be a gentle soul and allow more robots for the other team to compete! May the brightest shine!

While previous part of the workshop were about teaching, this one is all about exploring. Start with the bricks you already have, and build up from them in order to create algorithm that fits your need. Don't hesitate to grow out of this workshop and read from other online/offline sources. This is the beauty of it, you're not restricted in anyway. Think of a glorious algorithm and let your robots have it all!
