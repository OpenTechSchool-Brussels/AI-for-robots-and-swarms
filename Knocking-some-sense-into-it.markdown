Ground sensors (?)
    knowing when you're arrived: reaching places = LOCALISE

Proximity sensor
    add obstacle to the path: obstacle avoidance = NAVIGATE

Light sensor
    Locating the light (do we get distance or just angle?)
    If distance too => Braintenberg vehicules :D
    If not, then we'll use the camera...
    

This section's Game = Something based on Braintenberg vehicules!
