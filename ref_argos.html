		                The base ground sensor reads the color of the floor.
		                It is a list of 8 readings, each containing a table composed of
		                <code>value</code> and <code>offset</code>. The value is either 0 or 1, where
		                0 means black (or dark gray), and 1 means white (or light gray). The offset
		                corresponds to the position read on the ground by the sensor. The position is
		                expressed as a 2D vector stemming from the center of the robot. The vector
		                coordinates are in cm.<br>
				The difference between this sensor and the <code>robot.motor_ground</code> is
				that this sensor returns binary readings (0 = black/1 = white), while
				<code>robot.motor_ground</code> can distinguish different shades of gray.

		                The distance scanner is a rotating device with four sensors. Two sensors are
		                short-range (4cm to 30cm) and two are long-range (20cm to 150cm). Each sensor
		                returns up to 6 values every time step, for a total of 24 readings (12 short-range
		                and 12 long-range). Each reading is a table composed of <code>angle</code> in
		                radians and <code>distance</code> in cm. The distance value can also be -1
				or -2. When it is -1, it means that the object detected by the sensor is closer
				than the minimum sensor range (4cm for short-range, 20cm for long-range). When
				a sensor returns -2, it's because no object was detected at all.<br>
		                This device is initially off. You need to use the <code>enable()</code> function
		                to switch it on. The function <code>disable</code> switches it off.
		                The function <code>set_angle()</code> locks the device at a specific angle, while
		                <code>set_rpm(s)</code> sets the angular speed of the device to <code>s</code>
		                (which must be a number). If you want to convert from radians per second to
				RPMs, apply the following formula: <em>RPM</em> = 30/pi * <em>radsec</em>.

		                To set the colors of a single LED, use <code>set_single_color(idx, color)</code>.
		                <code>idx</code> is the number of the LED to set (1-12 for the body LEDs, 13 for

                    The range-and-bearing system allows robots to perform <em>localized communication</em>.
                    Localized communication means that a robot, upon receiving data from another robot, also
                    detects the position of the sender with respect to its local point of view. It is important
                    to notice that the range-and-bearing system is not like WiFi. First, because two robots can exchange
                    data only if they are in direct line of sight - if an object is between two robots, the robots
                    can't communicate. Second, because robots that send data can only broadcast it in a limited area -
                    you can't pick who you talk to as you would with an IP address. Third, the robots can exchange only
                    10 bytes of data.<br>
                    To set the data to broadcast, use <code>set_data()</code>. This function accepts input in two forms.
                    You can write <code>set_data(idx, data)</code>, and this means that you set the <code>idx</code>-th
                    byte to the value of <code>data</code>. <code>data</code> must be a number in the range [0,255].
                    Alternatively, you can write <code>set_data(data)</code>, where <code>data</code> must be a table
                    containing exactly 10 numbers in the range [0,255].<br>
                    At each time step, a robot receives a variable number of messages from nearby robots. Each message
                    is stored in a table composed of <code>data</code> (the 10-bytes message payload),
                    <code>horizontal_bearing</code> (the angle between the robot local <em>x</em> axis and the position
                    of the message source; the angle is on the robot's <em>xy</em> plane, in radians),
                    <code>vertical_bearing</code> (like the horizontal bearing, but it is the angle between the message
                    source and the robot's <em>xy</em> plane), and <code>range</code> (the distance of the message
                    source in cm).

                    The real robot moves using two sets of wheels and tracks called <em>treels</em>. For simplicity,
                    we treat the treels like normal wheels.<br>
                    To move the robot, use <code>set_velocity(l,r)</code> where <code>l</code> and <code>r</code> are
                    the left and right wheel velocity, respectively. By 'wheel velocity' we mean <em>linear</em> velocity.
                    In other words, if you say <code>set_velocity(5,5)</code>, the robot will move forward at 5cm/s.<br>
                    You can get some information about robot motion and wheels, too. <code>axis_length</code> is the distance
                    between the two wheels in cm. <code>velocity_left</code> and <code>velocity_right</code> store the current
                    wheel velocity. <code>distance_left</code> and <code>distance_right</code> store the linear distance
                    covered by the wheels in the last time step.

				The foot-bot gripper is attached to a rotating device called the <em>gripper</em>. You can control the gripper

				call <code>set_rotation(angle)</code> to rotate the gripper at angle <code>angle</code>. Alternatively,
				you can set the rotational speed by calling <code>set_speed_control_mode()</code> first, and then
