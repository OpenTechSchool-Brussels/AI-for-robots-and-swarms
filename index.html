title:  "Welcome to your Generative Art Processing Workshop!"
---

<p>I'm glad you're here, and I hope you're too! In this workshop, you will learn ............
</p>

<p>This material is not stable yet, so it might still be a bit messy. Don't hesitate to give us some feedback on how well (bad?) we did! Unfortunately this time the workshop is picture free but we promise we'll add some for its next iterations.</p>

<p>******</p>

<p>Some fundamental advices for beginner programmers (you might want to come back here if you have issues):
<ol>
<li><b>Get your hands dirty.</b> You'll only learn if you write and run some code. Each piece of code shared has some meaning. Run them all, and don't hesiate to tweak them, push them forward and explore both your ideas and what you can do with it.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing.</b> You need to understand each line of your code, especially in this workshop since we'll probably reuse them and make you modify them short after. If you're not 100% you understand, reread the course. Maybe try the next paragraph. Ask a fellow student, a coach, search online... Anything, but don't continue if you don't understand.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing!</b> It's fundamental to undersand the grammar of your lines of code, but it's as important to understand its meaning, and place in your code. You're coding your line at a specific place, it has a specific role. Understand that role. Not only of your line but also of your group of lines so that a structure of your code emerge. Sometimes you'll be asked to replace some code, it'll be up to you to understand what to replace.</li>
<li><b>Don't copy paste.</b> While it might seem as a quick way to advance the material, you will learn less. The more you will write, the more you will remember. And even better, whenever there are number used, try to tweak them, modify them a bit, see what happens.</li>
</ol>

<p>During the workshop, you’ll be granted the superpower of the Screenshot! Ancient technology will allow you to get straight from Processing a screenshot of your realisations. Please, share them with coaches, and don’t hesitate to add them in the Processing OTS event on meetup!</p>

<p>Now that we get to know each other, let's dive into the course itself.</p>
