title:  "Welcome to your Artificial Intelligence Workshop!"
---


<p>You're a next generation strategist. You don't command your troupes, you build their brain.</p>


<p>The aim of this workshop is to give you an insight of what Artificial Intelligence (later shorten as AI) looks like when applied to robotics and swarm robotics. Using the Lua programming language and the sensors and actuators of the robots, you will create simple to more complex behaviours for robots depending on their given task.</p>

<p>If in a first time you will work on robots taken one by one, you will quickly learn how to create constructive interaction between robots so that won't work each on their own, but collaborate and work as one entity : a swarm.</p>

<p>It's interesting to note that the simulator you you will be using (ARGoS) is a tool created for research, and used al around the world in laboratories. While we will use it as an educational tool and later as a gaming platform, its constrains & quality are the same than such that would be required by a professional and research environment, making it as close as possible as programming on real robots.</p>

<p>Last, this workshop is also a platform of experimentation in new kind of strategy games. In this setup, you don't order your troops around, but you create (in advance or on the fly) their intelligence so that they decide how to achieve their objective and react to unforeseen obstacles. A few simple games will punctuate each section, with a bigger one as a red thread. Most are meant to be played with multiple opponent so we can make AIs battle each other. The aim here is to check the interest in such activity and build a community around with hackatons and other events in mind.</p>

<p>This material is not stable yet, so it might still be a bit messy. Don't hesitate to give us some feedback on how well (bad?) we did!</p>

<p>Some fundamental advices for beginner programmers (you might want to come back here if you have issues):
<ol>
<li><b>Get your hands dirty.</b> You'll only learn if you write and run some code. Each piece of code shared has some meaning. Run them all, and don't hesitate to tweak them, push them forward and explore both your ideas and what you can do with it.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing.</b> You need to understand each line of your code, especially in this workshop since we'll probably reuse them and make you modify them short after. If you're not 100% you understand, reread the course. Maybe try the next paragraph. Ask a fellow student, a coach, search online... Anything, but don't continue if you don't understand.</li>
<li><b>Understand what you're doing!</b> It's fundamental to understand the grammar of your lines of code, but it's as important to understand its meaning, and place in your code. You're coding your line at a specific place, it has a specific role. Understand that role. Not only of your line but also of your group of lines so that a structure of your code emerge. Sometimes you'll be asked to replace some code, it'll be up to you to understand what to replace.</li>
<li><b>Don't copy paste.</b> While it might seem as a quick way to advance the material, you will learn less. The more you will write, the more you will remember. And even better, whenever there are number used, try to tweak them, modify them a bit, see what happens.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we get to know each other, let's dive into the course itself.</p>
